# Gyroscope-Tilt-Warning-System
A simple Arduino-based project that detects excessive tilt using an MPU6050 gyroscope/accelerometer and triggers a buzzer and serial warning when the device tilts beyond a safe angle.  Ideal for use in small robots, safety systems, or orientation-sensitive applications.
